# RestfulBlogAPI
Node Assignment
1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?
  Just followed instruction. The three challanges I faced was
  a)In server.js module, while calling posts function , I used getPosts(). The error node gave me was misleading. Node was complaining     about res.status not valid in posts module
  b)figuring out Objects.assign was a challenge
  c)next parameter in app.use(req,res,next)

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? If you used any specific curl requests, let us know.
Used postman to test the project.

3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewers will know ahead of time
everything worked fine.
